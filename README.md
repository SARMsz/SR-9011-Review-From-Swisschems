<h1>SR‑9011 Review: My Personal Experience with Swisschems’ Endurance Booster</h1>

<p>I’ve tested dozens of SARMs and performance enhancers over the past two years. SR‑9011 from Swisschems quickly became one of my top picks for boosting endurance, improving recovery, and dialing in a lean, cut look. In this review, I’ll share exactly how I tested and ranked this product, my personal results, and why I believe it’s a must‑try for anyone chasing better stamina and fat loss.</p>

<h2>What Is SR‑9011?</h2>
<p>SR‑9011 is a REV‑ERB agonist SARM that targets your body’s circadian rhythm and metabolic rate. It works by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activating REV‑ERB proteins in muscle fibers and mitochondria</li>
  <li>Increasing thermal energy production (thermogenesis)</li>
  <li>Boosting VO<sub>2</sub> max and oxygen uptake</li>
  <li>Enhancing cellular mitochondrial biogenesis</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination makes SR‑9011 ideal for lean muscle definition, faster recovery, and sustained energy during cardio sessions.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems’ SR‑9011</h2>
<p>My testing protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 weeks, two cycles of 4 weeks on / 2 weeks off</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 10mg per day (5mg capsule, taken twice)</li>
  <li><strong>Training split:</strong> 3 days strength training / 3 days HIIT or steady‑state cardio</li>
  <li><strong>Diet:</strong> High‑protein (2g per kg bodyweight), moderate carbs, moderate fat</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> VO<sub>2</sub> max test, resting heart rate, body fat caliper readings</li>
</ul>
<p>I also gathered feedback from three workout partners using the same protocol. We compared energy levels, workout performance, and recovery on rest days.</p>

<h2>My Personal Results</h2>
<p>By Week 2, I noticed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20% faster warm‑up: I felt ready to go sooner in every session</li>
  <li>Lower resting heart rate: down from 62 to 58 bpm</li>
  <li>Improved mood and focus: fewer energy crashes mid‑day</li>
</ul>
<p>By Week 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VO<sub>2</sub> max up by 8%</li>
  <li>Body fat dropped from 14% to 11% without cutting calories</li>
  <li>Muscle fullness and vascularity improved</li>
</ul>
<p>My partners reported similar boosts in stamina and recovery. One friend could push an extra 2 intervals in his HIIT session, and another shaved 30 seconds off his 5K time.</p>
